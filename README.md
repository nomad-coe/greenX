# GreenX Library 

The Green X library is developed under Work Package 2 of the NOMAD Center of Excellence. 

## Installation

Green X has been designed as a collection of libraries, which can be built relatively 
independently of one another. To build the whole suite of Green X libraries from the source 
you need to have a Fortran compiler supporting Fortran 2008, and one of the supported build 
systems:

* cmake version 3.15.0 or newer, with a build-system backend, i.e. `make`.

**Building with CMake**   

To build all libraries, set up a build directory, change to it and run cmake 
configuration:

```bash
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ../
```

To explicitly specify the compiler, run CMake configure with:

```bash
FC=ifort cmake ../
```
Shared libraries are built by default. To build static versions, one can 
configure with:

```bash
cmake ../ -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
```

If all requirements are found, build and install the project:

 ```bash
make -j
make install 
 ```

## Running the Tests

GreenX uses pytest as its regression testing framework, in conjunction with 
some custom python modules. First, one must ensure that the python utilities
are installed. From the GreenX root directory:

```bash
cd python
pip install -e .
```

One notes that the user may wish to change the scope of `pip install` to the
Python user install directory of their platform. Typically `~/.local/`. This
can be achieved with:

```bash
pip install --user -e .
```

unless working in a virtual environment, in which case it is not required.  

The test suite can now be run with CMake's ctest command:

 ```bash
cd build
ctest
 ```

## Building Documentation

GreenX is documented using Doxygen, and documentation support is enabled by
default. To disable CMake looking for Doxygen, configure with:

```bash
cmake ../ -DENABLE_DOCS=OFF
```

To build the document, type in the build directory:

```bash
make docs
```

Documentation is built in `documentation` and can be viewed by opening
`html/index.html` in a browser.

When adding new files with documentation, please ensure the directory is listed 
in the `INPUT` tag of Doxyfile.


## Unit Testing

### Installing the Unit-Testing Framework

Unit tests require the unit-testing framework [Zofu](https://github.com/acroucher/zofu).
To build Zofu, from GreenX's root (noting that one must define `$GX_ROOT`):

```bash
mkdir external && cd external
git clone https://github.com/acroucher/zofu.git
mkdir build && cd build
cmake \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release \
   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${GX_ROOT}/external/zofu/install \
   -DZOFU_FORTRAN_MODULE_INSTALL_DIR:PATH=include \
   ..
make -j 4
make install
```

### Running Unit Tests

GreenX can be built with unit-testing enabled using:

```bash
cmake -DENABLE_UNITTESTS=ON -DZOFU_PATH=${GX_ROOT}/external/zofu/install ../
```

Unit tests are run with the application tests, using ctest. Simply type `ctest`
in the build directory.

### Adding Unit Tests

For an example of writing a unit test, see `GX-AnalyticContinuation/src/test_pade_approximant.f90`.
A unit test is a module and follows the naming convention `test_MODULENAME.f90`.
The unit test itself is a module containing subroutines which set up some data,
call the routine under test, and make some assertions on the resulting data.
Zofu provides the object with which to make the assertions and carry the result.
One should write a separate test module for each fortran module they wish to test.

Unit tests are added to the build system straightforwardly:

1. Create a directory in the build folder that will contain the test binary.
A good convention is `unit_tests/sublibrary_name`:

```cmake
set(UNIT_TEST_DIR "${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/unit_tests/analytic-continuation")
file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ${UNIT_TEST_DIR})
message("-- Analytic continuation unit tests written to: ${UNIT_TEST_DIR}")
```

Noting one is free to choose any name for `UNIT_TEST_DIR`.

2. Create a list of libraries which your  unit tests depend upon. Typically
the library associated with that subfolder, for which the module is a part of.

```cmake
# Libraries on which the unit tests depend
set(LIBS_FOR_UNIT_TESTS LibGXAC)
```

Noting one is free to choose any name for `LIBS_FOR_UNIT_TESTS`.

3. Call the function `create_unit_test_executable` to define the unit test:

```cmake
create_unit_test_executable(TARGET_TEST_DIR ${UNIT_TEST_DIR}
                            TEST_NAME "test_pade_approximant"
                            REQUIRED_LIBS ${LIBS_FOR_UNIT_TESTS})
```

For multiple tests, one could call `create_unit_test_executable` in a loop over 
a list of modules.
